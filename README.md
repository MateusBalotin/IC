# Undergraduate Research Project

This repository contain 2 projects about Reinforcement Learning, more specifically of Q-Learning, which I did with my mentor Lucas Pedroso.

<h1> Cartpole </h1>

<p> This project is about a fairly common algorithm to understand DQN - Double Q-Networks, where the objective of the game <br>
is that the cart and pole doesn't move a lot. If the pole fall beyond a certain angle it's game over and the samme applies <br>
when the cart moves too far away</p>

<p> In the project I basically defined the fundamental things about Q-Learning and later on just called Neural Networs to train the model</p>

<h1> Freezing Lake</h1>


<p> This code is to show the basics of Q-Learning, especially Q-Table, without using any complicated means.</p>

<p> This game is basically one where you threw a frisbie to your dog in the middle of a ice lake and now you need to go get it,<br>
your dog is a lazy one. You can move to 9 places and the actions are left, right, up and down. <br>
There's 3 types of blocks, the blocks in which you can stand on, those that has a hole and it's game over if you go on them and <br>
the last one where the frisbie is.
